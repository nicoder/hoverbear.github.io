<li>As a Computer Science student at UVic, I took three very insightful courses.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Hoverbear/csc-360">CSC 360</a> - <strong>Operating Sytems</strong>, with Professor Michael Zastre. Material included system calls, threading, deadlocking, concurrency, parallelism, filesystems, hardware, DMA, memory allocation (Slab, Buddy List), CPU Scheduling, as well as a thrilling ride through computing history.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Hoverbear/csc-361">CSC 361</a> - <strong>Networking</strong>, with Professor Jianping Pan. Material included layers 1-7 of the TCP/IP stack, BGP, OSPF, NAT, TCP Headers, IP Headers, TCP, UDP, C networking code, sockets, and handshakes.</li>

<li>Also in contract with the BCAAFC, worked throughout the summer to help build and maintain office services and support.</li>
<li>As a Computer Science student at UVic, took a pair of challenging courses.

<ul>
<li>MATH 201 - <strong>Differential Equations</strong>, with Professor Florin Diacu.</li>
<li>SENG 271 - <strong>Software Modelling and Design Patterns</strong>, with Professor Jens Weber. Material included fundamental design patterns, how to sketch out programs, conceptual insights into logic and data flows, and the values of safe, proper engineering.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Volunteered with the Aboriginal Back-to-School Picnic</li>
</ul>

<h4>Spring</h4>

<ul>
<li>In contract with the BCAAFC, helped plan and host their 11th Gathering Our Voices Aboriginal Youth Conference in Penticton, British Columbia. Much of my time was spent learning proper software design and refining that within the management and registration software. The event attracted over 1700 participants, their largest ever at the time.</li>
<li>As a Computer Science student at UVic. Took three courses.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Hoverbear/seng-265-projects">SENG 265</a> - <strong>Software Develop Methods</strong>, with Professor Michael Zastre. Topics included Bash, Make, Python, C, dynamic memory, string manipulation, and file processing.</li>
