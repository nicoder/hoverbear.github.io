This is a fairly exhaustive log which was started in summer 2014. After summer 2013 things start to get a bit fuzzy, excuse me.

### 2014

#### Summer (Current)
* NSERC USRA (Undergraduate Student Research Award) recipient, working with Lead Lab (UBC) and Simbioses Lab (UVic SENG/CS)
   * Developing new client for a Data Visualization Hub to be part of the SCOOP Health Information Network.
   * Architecting and Specifying a stable API for communication between the front-end and back-end.
   * (Possible) Develop new server application of Visualization Hub.
* Volunteering for the Aboriginal Back-to-School Picnic, helped build a simple registrating system using Google Forms.

#### Spring
* In contract with the BCAAFC, helped plan, organize, and host their 12th Gathering Our Voices Aboriginal Youth Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. It was their largest and most successful event, attracting over 2000 participants. This year I was part of the core team.
   * Negotiated contract with event photographer Geoff Howe.
   * Maintained and tailored custom developed management software.
   * Helped plan layout, schedules, contests, and events.
* Sponsored by LE'NO<span style="text-decoration: underline">N</span>ET, worked with the UVic based non-profit, Science Venture.
   * 'Saturday Science Clubs' to grade 5/6 students weekly over 4 months.
   * 'Coding Club' with grade 6/7 students weekly over 4 months.
   * Outreach at the T'Souke First Nation weekly over 4 months.
   * Hosted 4 workshops at Gathering Our Voices.
* Sponsored by LE'NO<span style="text-decoration: underline">N</span>ET, worked with Lead Lab (UBC Family Practice) and Simbioses Lab (UVic SENG/CS).
   * Reviewed a distributed Health Information Network's design, considering group and individual privacy.
   * Provided a set of reccomended modifications.
   
### 2013

#### Winter
* In contract with the BCAAFC, developed version 2 of Gathering Our Voice's custom conference management software. Used Mongoose (A MongoDB ODM), Node.JS, Bootstrap, and Redis. Core functionality was tested via TravisCI, and the software was deployed to Heroku.
* As a Computer Science student at UVic, I took three very insightful courses.
   * [CSC 360](https://github.com/Hoverbear/csc-360) - **Operating Sytems**, with Professor Michael Zastre. Material included system calls, threading, deadlocking, concurrency, parallelism, filesystems, hardware, DMA, memory allocation (Slab, Buddy List), CPU Scheduling, as well as a thrilling ride through computing history.
   * [CSC 361](https://github.com/Hoverbear/csc-361) - **Networking**, with Professor Jianping Pan. Material included layers 1-7 of the TCP/IP stack, BGP, OSPF, NAT, TCP Headers, IP Headers, TCP, UDP, C networking code, sockets, and handshakes.
   * [CSC 370](https://github.com/Hoverbear/csc-370) - **Databases**, with Professor Michael Zastre. Material included relational database design, PostgresSQL, psycopg2 (Python PGSQL Driver), relational algebra, and normal forms (BCNF, 3NF, 4NF).
   
#### Summer
* In contract with the BCAAFC, helped orcestrate and carry out a full office (and infrastructure) move. Our two-person team successfully transferred services in under one working weekend day.
* Also in contract with the BCAAFC, worked throughout the summer to help build and maintain office services and support.
* As a Computer Science student at UVic, took a pair of challenging courses.
   * MATH 201 - **Differential Equations**, with Professor Florin Diacu.
   * SENG 271 - **Software Modelling and Design Patterns**, with Professor Jens Weber. Material included fundamental design patterns, how to sketch out programs, conceptual insights into logic and data flows, and the values of safe, proper engineering.
* Volunteered with the Aboriginal Back-to-School Picnic
   
#### Spring
* In contract with the BCAAFC, helped plan and host their 11th Gathering Our Voices Aboriginal Youth Conference in Penticton, British Columbia. Much of my time was spent learning proper software design and refining that within the management and registration software. The event attracted over 1700 participants, their largest ever at the time.
* As a Computer Science student at UVic. Took three courses.
   * [SENG 265](https://github.com/Hoverbear/seng-265-projects) - **Software Develop Methods**, with Professor Michael Zastre. Topics included Bash, Make, Python, C, dynamic memory, string manipulation, and file processing.
   * CSC 106 - **Practice of Computer Science**, with Professor Amy Gooch.
   * IS 310 - **LE'NO<span style="text-decoration: underline">N</span>ET Prep Seminar**, with Professors Rob Hancock and Dawn Smith.
