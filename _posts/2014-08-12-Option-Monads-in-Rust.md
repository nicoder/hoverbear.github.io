title: Option Monads in Rust
---

One common monadic structure is the `Option` or `Maybe` type. This can be seen as an encapsulation type. Consider a function which may fail to produce a meaningful value for certain inputs. For example, 

```rust
fn main () {
  // Parses a string into an integer.
  from_str::<int>("4"); // A valid input.
  from_str::<int>("Potato"); // Definitely invalid.
}
```

The `from_str` function cannot return a meaningful value for `"Potato"`. Rust (and many other functional languages) does not have `null`, so what should we return? This is where an `Option` type becomes useful. In our example, instead of returning an `int` type `from_str` returns an `Option<int>` type.

In Rust, the `Option` enum is represented by either `Some(x)` or `None`, where `x` is the encapsulated value. In this way, the `Option` monad can be thought of like a box. It encapsulates the value `x`, where `x` is any type. Rust defines an `Option` as such, where `<T>` and `(T)` denote that it handles a generic type, meaning that `T` could be an `int`, a `str`, a `vec`, or anything else, even other `Option` types.

```rust
enum Option<T> { None, Some(T) }
```

### Value In, Value Out

Since we can see an `Option` as a box, or encapsulation type, we need to be able to put things into the box, or take things out.

Putting a value into an `Option` is delightfully simple. Simply use `Some(x)` or `None` in place of `x` or (an imaginary) `null`. Most of the time, you will receive or return an `Option` based on input, rather then just creating them directly.

```rust
fn main () {
    // Ways to create an Option containing an int.
    let w = Some(3i); // Something
    let x: Option<int> = None; // Nothing
    // Recieve from function.
    let y = some_on_even(2); // Something
    let z = some_on_even(3); // Nothing
}

fn some_on_even(val: int) -> Option<int> {
    match val {
        // Matches an even number.
        even if even % 2 == 0 => Some(even),
        // Matches anything else.
        _                     => None
    }
}
```

To take something out of the `Option` we need to be able to extract, or "unwrap" the value. There are a number of ways to do this. Some common methods are with a `match`, or `.expect()`. 

> If you're seeking to write code that won't crash, avoid `.expect()` and it's cousin `.unwrap()` and use safer alternatives like `unwrap_or_default()`, or `unwrap_or()`.

```rust
fn main () {
    // Create an Option containing the value 1.
    let a_monad: Option<int> = Some(1);
    // Extract and branch based on result.
    let value_from_match = match a_monad {
        Some(x) => x,
        None    => 0i // A fallback value.
    };
    // Extract with failure message.
    let value_from_expect = a_monad.expect("No result.");
    // Extract, or get a default value 
    let value_or_default = a_monad.unwrap_or_default();
    let value_or_fallback = a_monad.unwrap_or(42i);
}
```

### Not Just a Null

By now, you're probably asking yourself something similar to the following:

> So why not just have `null`? What does an `Option` monad provide that's more?

That's a very good question. What are the benefits of this idiom?

* **You must handle all possible returns, or lack thereof.** The compiler will emit errors if you don't appropriately handle an `Option`. You can't just *forget* to handle the `None` (or 'null') case.
* **Null doesn't exist.** It's immediately apparent to readers and consumers which functions might not return a meaningful value. Attempting to use a value from an `Option` without handling it results in a compiler error.
* **Composition becomes easy.** The `Option` monad becomes much more powerful when it is used in composition, as it's characteristics allow for pipelines to be created which don't need to explicitly handle errors at each step.

Lets take a closer look at the composition idea...

### Composing a Symphony of Functions

Nirvana is being able to compose a series of functions together without introducing a tight dependency between them, such that they could be moved or changed without needing to be concerned with how this might affect the other functions. For example, lets say we have some functions with the following signatures:

```rust
fn half(value: f64)    -> f64; // This could fail. (5 / 2 == ??)
fn sqrt(value: f64)    -> f64; // This could fail. (sqrt(-2) == ??)
fn square(value: f64)  -> f64;
fn double(value: f64)  -> f64;
fn inverse(value: f64) -> f64;
```

Quite the little math library we have here! How about we come up with a way to turn `20` into `20`, using a round-about pipeline?

```rust
sqrt((-1 * ((-1 * (20 * 2)) / 2))^2)
```

With our little library it'd look something like this:

```rust
// This code will not compile, it's invalid.
// `Null` isn't a real type in Rust.
fn main () {
    let number: f64 = 20.;
    match half(inverse(double(number))) {
        x => {
            match sqrt(square(inverse(x)))) {
                y => println!("The result is {}", y),
                Null => println!(".sqrt failed.")
            }
        },
        Null => println!(".half failed.")
    }
}
```

In this case, we had two functions which could fail, since we didn't have an `Option` type, we must explicitly handle possible `Null` values. Do note that the onus was on **the programmer** to know when a `Null` might be returned, and remember to handle it.

Lets see what the same code would look like using the `Option` monad. In this example, all of the functions are appropriately defined.

```rust
fn main () {
    let number: f64 = -5.;
    let result = Some(number)
        .map(double) // described later.
        .map(inverse)
        .and_then(half) // described later.
        .map(inverse)
        .map(square)
        .and_then(sqrt);
    match result {
        Some(x) => println!("Result was {}.", x),
        None    => println!("This failed.")
    }
}
fn half(value: f64) -> Option<f64> {
    match value {
        x if (x as int) % 2 == 0 => Some(x / 2.),
        _                        => None
    }
}
fn sqrt(value: f64) -> Option<f64> {
    match value.sqrt() {
        x if x.is_normal() => Some(x),
        _                  => None
    }
}
fn double(value: f64) -> f64 {
    value * 2.
}
fn square(value: f64) -> f64 {
    value.powi(2 as i32)
}
fn inverse(value: f64) -> f64 {
    value * -1.
}
```

This code handles all possible result branches cleanly, and the author need not explicitly deal with each possible `None` result, they only need to handle one. If any of the functions which may fail (called by `and_then()`) do fail, the rest of the computation is bypassed. Additionally, it makes expressing and understanding the pipeline of computations much easier.

`map` and `and_then` (along with a gamut of other functions listed [here](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/type.Option.html)) provide a robust set of tools for composing functions together. Lets take a look, their signatures are below.

```rust
fn and_then<U>(self, f: |T| -> Option<U>) -> Option<U>
fn map<U>     (self, f: |T| -> U)         -> Option<U>
```
